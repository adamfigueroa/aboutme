            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Throughout my past careers; whether it was customer service, cellular sales, or tech production I found that my favorite aspects of those jobs was when I was a part of a team in pursuit of a goal or learning about new technologies and how they came to be. This is what sparked an interest in pursuing a career in Software Engineering.</p>
            <p>Outside of my growing passion for web development I enjoy hanging out with friends, DMing for my Dungeons and Dragons group, spending as much time outdoors as I can and camping any chance I get!</p>
